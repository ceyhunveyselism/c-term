# c-term
Terminal made in C# that is superior to Deltact's D-Term.
This terminal is made by Ceyhun against the fact that D-Term (made by Delta) is written in Python, extremely implicit, improper, improfessional and impractical.
This project aims to fix all those issues by adding a lot of functionality, interpreter support (soon) and making it easy to add things onto unlike D-Term.

By all seriousness, this is just a competition between two friends (a C# and a Python dev) to see who can create the best terminal overall.
This is just a terminal that is all purpose (just like the cmd terminal) with features for a lot of things! Check the latest release, try to see if anything fits your type.
Issues and pull requests are always appreciated.
